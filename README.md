## Navigation & routing
Flutter uses [Navigator](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html) for navigation.

* [Official documentation on navigation](https://flutter.io/docs/development/ui/navigation)
* [Flutter Navigation for Android developers](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#what-is-the-equivalent-of-an-intent-in-flutter)

## Handling incoming intents

## Network requests and Serialization

No, there's no Retrofit or Gson/Moshi in Flutter.

* [OkHttp/Retrofit](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio)
* [Fetch data from Internet](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook/networking/fetch-data)
* [JSON serialization](https://flutter.io/docs/development/data-and-backend/json)

## Persistence

* [Shared Preferences](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-access-shared-preferences)
* To interact with SQLite you use [sqflite plugin](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/sqflite)


## Reactive/Rx
Dart is a reactive language out of the box, you can either use Dart's [Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/tutorials/language/streams) or [RxDart](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart) if you're familiar with ReactiveX.

## Activity/Fragment?
Both activities and fragments are represented as a Widget in Flutter.

## Lifecycle?

## Declarative vs Imperative
> In the imperative style, you would typically go to ViewB’s owner and retrieve the instance b using selectors or with findViewById or similar, and invoke mutations on it (and implicitly invalidate it). For example:

    // Imperative style
    b.setColor(red)
    b.clearChildren()
    ViewC c3 = new ViewC(...)
    b.add(c3)

> In the declarative style, view configurations (such as Flutter’s Widgets) are immutable and are only lightweight “blueprints”. To change the UI, a Widget triggers a rebuild on itself (most commonly by calling setState() on StatefulWidgets in Flutter) and constructs a new Widget subtree.

    // Declarative style
    return ViewB(
      color: red,
      child: ViewC(...),
    )

[Why Flutter uses declarative UI](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/declarative#why-a-declarative-ui)

[SnackBar](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar) | [SnackBar](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/SnackBar-class.html)

## Hint on an EditText

To add a hint to an EditText([TextField](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/TextField-class.html)) you add [InputDecoration](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) to it:

    body: Center(
      child: TextField(
        decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: "This is a hint"),
      )
    )

## Custom Views/Canvas drawing
Flutter has similar to Android [Canvas API](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-use-a-canvas-to-drawpaint).

To create [custom widgets](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-build-custom-widgets) you compose smaller widgets.

## Gesture and click listeners
* [How to add onClick listener](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-add-an-onclick-listener-to-a-widget-in-flutter)
* [Gesture detection](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-handle-other-gestures-on-widgets)

## Glide/Picasso/Fresco(Image loading)?

Flutter is able to [load images](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook/images/network-image) from URL out of the box, all you have to do is use the [Image.network](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Image/Image.network.html) constructor, like this: 

    Image.network(
      'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/website/master/src/_includes/code/layout/lakes/images/lake.jpg',
    )

It also supports gifs!

Unfortunately, Image.network [does not support](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook/images/network-image#placeholders-and-caching) placeholders and/or caching. To achieve those, please see the following recipes:
* [Fade in images with a placeholder](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook/images/fading-in-images)
* [Working with cached images](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook/images/cached-images)

## Animations

## Theming

## Gradle 
Flutter uses Dart's own build system, and the Pub package manager. You can read more about [here](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#what-is-the-equivalent-of-a-gradle-file-how-do-i-add-dependencies).

## Plugins/Libraries 
[Packages](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter) allow you to use Flutter packages or access underlying platform features in a form of a library.

* [Dart pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter/packages)(like [Jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) in Java world)
* [Official Flutter plugins from Flutter repo](https://github.com/flutter/plugins)

## Local notifications

For local notifications you would have to rely on a 3rd party plugin.
